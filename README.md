# Fix xrdp in Ubuntu 22.04 (and maybe other versions)
Ubuntu 22.04 xrdp installation defaults configurations usually display a blank screen.

This repository aims to replace the default configuration with one that both fixes this problem and also allows multiple remote connections.

Simply run **_fix.sh_** on a shell.
